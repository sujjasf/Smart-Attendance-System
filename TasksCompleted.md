# Project Tasks Completed

This document outlines the features and steps that have been completed for the Smart Attendance System project.

## Core Project Setup

- **Django Project:** Initialized the `attendance_system` project and the `attendance_app`.
- **Configuration Files:** Created and configured:
    - `requirements.txt` with all necessary packages.
    - `.gitignore` to exclude unnecessary files.
    - `.env.example` for environment variables.
    - `README.md` with basic setup instructions.
- **Settings:** Configured `settings.py` for:
    - MySQL database connection.
    - Static and media file handling.
    - Loading sensitive data from a `.env` file.

## Database

- **Models:** Created the `Student` and `Attendance` models with the following fields:
    - **Student:** `name`, `roll_number`, `email`, `face_encoding`, `qr_code`, `created_at`.
    - **Attendance:** `student`, `date`, `time`, `verification_method`.
- **Migrations:** Generated and applied database migrations to create the necessary tables.

## Admin & Management

- **Django Admin:** Registered the `Student` and `Attendance` models to be manageable through the admin interface.
- **QR Code Generation:** The `Student` model automatically generates a QR code for the `roll_number` when a new student is saved.

## Features

### QR Code Attendance

- **Scanning Page:** Created a `/qr-scan/` page that uses the webcam to scan QR codes.
- **Backend Logic:** The `QRScanView` handles the uploaded webcam image, decodes the QR code, finds the corresponding student, and marks their attendance.
- **User Interface:** The page provides feedback to the user on whether the scan was successful or if an error occurred.

### Basic Frontend

- **Templates:** Created a `base.html` template with Bootstrap for a consistent look and feel.
- **Pages:**
    - `home.html`: A welcoming home page.
    - `qr_scan.html`: The page for QR code scanning.
    - `face_recognition.html`: A placeholder page for the face recognition feature.
- **URL Routing:** Configured URL patterns for all the created pages.
